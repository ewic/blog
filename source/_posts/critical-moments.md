This is just a random thought that I have had about fighting game meta and how to apply it to matches and perhaps to real life.  My basic observation is that fighting game matches play out to some rhythm of gameplay punctuated by moments of player interaction that I call 'critical moments'.  I do not think this concept is foreign to experienced players, both of fighting games as well as many other games and sports, but I feel that it is nuanced enough to warrant some thought.

Most of my experience is associated with Street Fighter and its mechanics, but the concept is general enough to apply to any fighter.

## Example

I think the best way for me to explain this concept is by example, so let's watch a game and break it apart.  I'm going to handwave through most of the gameplay to focus just on the concept of the critical moment.  This is EVO 2013 Top 8 Infiltration (Akuma) vs Daigo Umehara (Ryu).  There's too much to talk about in each game, so I'm just looking at the first round.

## What am I looking for?

Infiltration opens with a demon flip and pushes into Daigo's space with low medium kicks.  This is all neutral game, and will be for the next several seconds.  In my opinion, the first critical moment happens after Daigo jumps forward, lands a crossup-medium kick, and confirms into a crouch fierce tatsu combo that pushes Infiltration to the corner.  This is the point at which one player has a clear set of options to him that are completely different from his opponents, and the next decision is made underneath these extremely skewed conditions.

To break it down, Infiltration is knocked down, in the corner, and Daigo has recovered from whatever move he did last, so is in a completely neutral state.  Daigo is therefore on the offensive and Infiltration is on the defensive.  At this point, Infiltration's options are all wakeup options and Daigo's are all meaty options, with the notable exception of doing nothing.

What Daigo does in reality is meaty a low short into a block string that Infiltration blocks on his wakeup.  This is the critical moment where the match could either go one way or another.  All matches, from the lows to the pros, are full of these moments, and I think it's a fun exercise to observe them and the way that they determine the outcomes of matches.  During this time, both players made their decision without any sort of ability to react, and thus had to act on some combination of reads, experience, and gut feeling.  If Infiltration had decided to wakeup with a reversal instead, he would have successfully hit Daigo's low short and the commentator would be talking about how Daigo overextended or something.

## How does this affect the rest of the match?

The next 20 seconds or so, basically until the next knockdown, is more neutral game during which Infiltration tries to make up his life deficit.  The only point of note is an interesting decision after Daigo's blockstring where he jumps back for some reason.  This resets the match back to a more neutral state, where Daigo would still be on the offensive, with better options overall, and Infiltration would be on the defensive, with his back to the wall.  

My best guess at Daigo's thought process behind that decision is that he was relying on his fundamentals to carry him through the next 80 seconds of the match, where he and Infiltration will do roughly the same amount of damage to each other, and Daigo will win first.  Playing that style is a safe option, and minimizes the amount of critical moments, since those are the points at which the lead can swing wildly in either direction.

## How is this different from Okizeme?

**Okizeme** is the metagame revolving around knockdown and wakeup, typically from the aggressor's point of view.  In my point of view, while I think it's true that critical moments are usually created off of knockdown situations, and there's always an element of oki involved, this is not always the case.  In many long pressure strings, there are holes through which a player might be able to reversal through.  I think of these as critical moments as well, because within the string exists the possibility to reverse the situation into a favorable one.

## How does this help my game?

One thing that I observe with newer players is that people tend to suffocate underneath pressure and aren't able to properly stop aggression.  Players will get mentally blocked trying to respond to everything and lose focus on critical moments.  If you are in the corner getting comboed, and there is no option to stop the combo, it makes no sense to even care about what buttons your opponent is pressing; you can't break out of it and there are more important things to care about.  

Instead it is more productive to focus on what *options* you have when the next critical moment appears.  It could be as simple as waiting for the pressure to naturally end, but some games have options to extend offense beyond a single combo or block string, so waiting might not cut it.  If the game isn't broken, there must exist some opportunity to break out and reverse the momentum in some way.

## In Conclusion

So hopefully there's something useful in this wall of text.  Most of my thoughts on fighters revolve around the newbie perspective because I just want everybody to enjoy fighters as much as I do.  There's a whole wealth of information on fighting game basics and mindset, but I hope that I can just offer a different way of looking at things.
